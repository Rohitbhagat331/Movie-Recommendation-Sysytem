# Movie-Recommendation-Sysytem

A Machine Learning Case Study for Recommendation System of movies based on collaborative filtering and content based filtering.

Tmdb is all about connecting people to the movies they love. To help customers find those movies, they developed world-class movie recommendation system: CinematchSM. Its job is to predict whether someone will enjoy a movie based on how much they liked or disliked other movies. Netflix use those predictions to make personal movie recommendations based on each customer’s unique tastes. And while Cinematch is doing pretty well, it can always be made better. Now there are a lot of interesting alternative approaches to how Cinematch works that Tmdb haven’t tried. Some are described in the literature, some aren’t. We’re curious whether any of these can beat Cinematch by making better predictions. Because, frankly, if there is a much better approach it could make a big difference to our customers and our business.
